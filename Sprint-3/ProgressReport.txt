By the time of submitting this, we will have decided our project idea will be a heat map visualization of the colors people use with their pull request labels. At this point we will be making a jupyter notebook page that will run all of the code to visualize the heat map, and that the notebook will be connected to a database. Then after this we will need to work on visualizing the heatmap, and having a regular color wheel next to it for comparison of where corresponding colors are on the heatmap.
