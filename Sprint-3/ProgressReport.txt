	We have decided our project idea will be a heat map visualization of the colors people use with 
their pull request labels. We will be making a jupyter notebook page that will run all of the code to 
visualize the heat map, and that the notebook will be connected to a database where it gets the data. 
	We have made a notebook similar to those in the chaoss/community-reports, as well as a config 
file that holds json with database credentials. We followed one of the notebooks and simply connected 
the notebook to the database with the credentials, and have 2 sql queries that were given to us to
retrieve the data we need from the databse. The next steps for us will be visualizing the data onto a 
heat map of usage amount and a regular color wheel next to it to show which colors the heat usage is
corresponding to.
