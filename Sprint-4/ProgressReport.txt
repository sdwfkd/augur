    All in all we were able to get the sql queries from the database with prestored credentials and make a heat map which corresponds to the actual color that was used in the pull requests, and the amount it was used. Given that there was only 2 of us there was not a lot of options as to what to do with this project, but given the ability to do this project or something similar with no deadline we might have been able to use similar techniques to be able to analyze the traffic given only the pull_request associated data. With a good deal of time it could be used to see if certain colors or labels were used because of certain situations with the person making the pull request. If there was some kind of correlation to the colors used and the usage or contribution of the public, it could help to streamline completely random people with looking at the project, seeing what they want it for, or what they want to help change, and then point them to how exactly they can help or use it without having to message some people online, where it could possibly take days to respond.
    Given that the amount of data we had to use was very small and what we did with it wasn't too complicated, there is a possibility to expand the project in such a way that if a lot more data was available, it could streamline the process of analyzing the behaviour of users online later when the amount of contribution is difficult to fully grasp.
