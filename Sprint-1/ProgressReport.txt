With the inability to get an AWS EC2 Instance to let anyone else connect, we are
currently unable to have anyone other than Spencer, who made the instance, work
on the project so far.

The EC2 Instance at one point did let us run the give postgresql commands to
create a database, create a user, and grant the user access, but then after a
short while made us refresh the connection upon which the whole postgresql
database appears to be running, but the EC2 instance won't let us reenter the
postgresql instance. Since then we have not tried to deploy augur just in case
it would cause some problem because of some unknown connection issue between the
augur and the database.

Other than these problems, we have come up with a project idea.
